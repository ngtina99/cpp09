✅ Time measurement

Use <chrono> (e.g., std::chrono::high_resolution_clock) to time sorting and preparation.


✅ Output format

Print the unsorted sequence.

Print the sorted sequence.

Print the time taken for both containers, clearly showing which is which.


#include <chrono>

auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
// Run sort here
auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
std::chrono::duration<double, std::micro> diff = end - start;
std::cout << "Time to process with std::vector: " << diff.count() << " us" << std::endl;
