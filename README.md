# C++ Module 09

This module focuses on mastering the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), using standard containers, iterators, and algorithms to solve complex problems efficiently.

## 🛠️ Usage

For each exercise, navigate to its folder, compile, and run:

📂 ex00

```bash
cd ex00
make
./btc
```
📂 ex01

```bash
cd ex01
make
./RPN
```

📂 ex02

```bash
cd ex02
make
./PmergeMe
```


## 📝 Exercise Descriptions
ex00 — Bitcoin Exchange:
Create a program btc that reads a date/value file and calculates the bitcoin value on that date using historical exchange rates. If the date isn’t present, use the closest lower date. Handle bad inputs with error messages.

ex01 — Reverse Polish Notation (RPN):
Create an RPN calculator program to evaluate reverse Polish mathematical expressions (e.g., 8 9 * 9 -). Only support single-digit numbers in the input, and handle operations +, -, /, *. Invalid expressions must output an error.

ex02 — PmergeMe:
Implement the Ford-Johnson merge-insert sort (merge-insert sort) using two different STL containers. Sort large sequences (3000+ integers) and measure the time taken for sorting with each container, displaying both the unsorted and sorted sequences.
